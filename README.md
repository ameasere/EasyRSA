## How To Use

To use EasyRSA, there are 2 options:

* Application/Binary
  - Download the latest application for your OS/Architecture [here](https://github.com/enigmapr0ject/EasyRSA/releases).
* Source Code
  - Clone this repository via the Command Line with `git clone https://github.com/enigmapr0ject/EasyRSA`, or download via the website.
  - Install [Python <3.11](https://python.org) for your OS/Architecture, and add to your PATH.
  - Install the project requirements via the Command Line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  - Execute the `main.py` file via the Command Line with `python main.py`, or using an IDE.
    - We highly recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), that is how we developed EasyRSA!

> **Note**
> As of the last README commit/update, Python 3.11+ is not supported. This is because Python 3.11 is still a new release. Every time a new version or subversion of Python is released, the required modules and requirements are not updated on PyPI - these have to be done manually by the maintainers, and so time is needed for this. Versions below 3.11 are **tested and verified** to work; the older you pick, the less likely however.

## Download

You can [download](https://github.com/enigmapr0ject/EasyRSA/releases/tag/0.0.5) the latest installable version of EasyRSA for Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Open-Source
